## Overview

### The challenge/User Stories

Project Description: The objective of this project is to Create and deploy a simple web application that follows the following requirements:  

-  Your web app must include a short bio about you and your professional history.
-  Your web app should display a few of your side projects or professional projects and should include a link to access the projects.  
-  Your web app should make an API call to display 3-5 pieces of data you retrieve from the API service. You are welcome to choose whatever API youâ€™d like to use.  
-  Include a section to explain why you chose the specific API you used in your project. 
-  Your web app should be designed using brand colours from the Co.Lab site. Please reference our website and see how we structure information and how buttons and links are designed.

## My process

- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router 

### What I learned

1. This project was done as Co.Lab Software Development Assessment (Co.Lab is a remote team building Bootcamp for web developers. It's a Chingu alternative). The suggestion was to spend no more than 4-5 hours completing this, but it took me under 72 hours. Could probably have done it in 2 days, if I sacrificed my Gym time.  
2. This project was my third attempt using React Router, and my most complete project to date. It's a full fledged mini website (WebDeveloper port-folio), and it's fully responsive. That means, ok to view from any type of device (desktop, phone, tablet etc).  

### Continued development

Next.js, freelance, open source contributions, collaborative work.
